# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The Purpose of this analysis was to use sql to request data and compile data to determine what the level of retiring employees was and to from that data analize the ability of the company currently to handle the "Silver Tsunami" that comes with a large number of retiries 
## Results
### In looking at the results from the data several conclusions can be drawn about the "Silver Tsunami"
  - The first being that a majority of retireies are those in senior positions 
  - Of the total number of retirees there is a signifigant number of the company within that group
  - in looking at mentor elegibilty numbers in comparison to retiree numbers they are below the number of retirees
  - There will be a deficit of about 40% of current posistions come the "Silver Tsunami" should reliance on mentorship be the lone stratergy be used to abate it's effects on training new workforce

## Summary 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
-90,398 roles will need to be filled across the total posistions 
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- On a one to one ratio there is not as out of the 90,000+ retires there is only around 53,000 capable of mentoring meaning around 40% of new employees would be without mentorship in that scenario 
### Additional Data that could improve Analyis
For addtional avenues of Analysis, what could be effective would be collecting data on mentorship candidates that can mentor more than a singular new employee so as to better give data on possible solutions, and from that tables could be produced which showcases number for mentors on the number of mentees they could take on. This as wekk could be suplemented with a table that compares those numbers to retirees to examine how much of a gap there is once the "Silver Tsunami" hits.
